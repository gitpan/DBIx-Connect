Herewith are included some sample scripts and config files that were used
for unit testing DBIx::Connect.  They should give you some idea of how to
do some pretty interesting things.  Feel free to play around with command
line arguments and DBI environment variables (such as $DBI_PASS, $DBI_DSN,
and so on) in conjunction with these configurations
